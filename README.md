# Note_taker

* This application helps the user write notes and saves the contents until deleted.
* I could not get the delete function to work, but everything saves. I will need to come back later and update it.
* Files added :
    * .gitignore
    * package.json
    * package-lock.json
    * server.js
    * Images
